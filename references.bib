	abstract = {[We introduce a class of models for an additive decomposition of groups of curves stratified by crossed and nested factors, generalizing smoothing splines to such samples by associating them with a corresponding mixed-effects model. The models are also useful for imputation of missing data and exploratory analysis of variance. We prove that the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) from the extended mixed-effects model correspond to solutions of a generalized penalized regression where smoothing parameters are directly related to variance components, and we show that these solutions are natural cubic splines. The model parameters are estimated using a highly efficient implementation of the EM algorithm for restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation based on a preliminary eigenvector decomposition. Variability of computed estimates can be assessed with asymptotic techniques or with a novel hierarchical bootstrap resampling scheme for nested mixed-effects models. Our methods are applied to menstrual cycle data from studies of reproductive function that measure daily urinary progesterone; the sample of progesterone curves is stratified by cycles nested within subjects nested within conceptive and nonconceptive groups.]},

	abstract = {Regression models for functional responses and scalar predictors are often fitted by means of basis functions, with quadratic roughness penalties applied to avoid  overfitting. The fitting approach described by Ramsay and Silverman in the 1990 s  amounts to a penalized ordinary least squares (P-OLS) estimator of the  coefficient functions. We recast this estimator as a generalized ridge regression  estimator, and present a penalized generalized least squares (P-GLS) alternative.  We describe algorithms by which both estimators can be implemented, with  automatic selection of optimal smoothing parameters, in a more computationally  efficient manner than has heretofore been available. We discuss pointwise  confidence intervals for the coefficient functions, simultaneous inference by  permutation tests, and model selection, including a novel notion of pointwise  model selection. P-OLS and P-GLS are compared in a simulation study. Our methods  are illustrated with an analysis of age effects in a functional magnetic  resonance imaging data set, as well as a reanalysis of a now-classic Canadian  weather data set. An R package implementing the methods is publicly available.},

	abstract = {A datum is often a continuous functionx(t) of a variable such as time observed over some interval. One or more such functions are observed for each subject or unit of observation. The extension of classical data analytic techniques designed forp-variate observations to such data is discussed. The essential step is the expression of the classical problem in the language of functional analysis, after which the extension to functions is a straightforward matter. A schematic device called the duality diagram is a very useful tool for describing an analysis and for suggesting new possibilities. Least squares approximation, descriptive statistics, principal components analysis, and canonical correlation analysis are discussed within this broader framework.},

	doi = {10.1111/rssc.12115},
	abstract = {This work is concerned with understanding common population-level effects of stroke on motor control while accounting for possible subject-level idiosyncratic  effects. Upper extremity motor control for each subject is assessed through  repeated planar reaching motions from a central point to eight pre-specified  targets arranged on a circle. We observe the kinematic data for hand position as  a bivariate function of time for each reach. Our goal is to estimate the  bivariate function-on-scalar regression with subject-level random functional  effects while accounting for potential correlation in residual curves; covariates  of interest are severity of motor impairment and target number. We express fixed  effects and random effects using penalized splines, and allow for residual  correlation using a Wishart prior distribution. Parameters are jointly estimated  in a Bayesian framework, and we implement a computationally efficient  approximation algorithm using variational Bayes. Simulations indicate that the  proposed method yields accurate estimation and inference, and application results  suggest that the effect of stroke on motor control has a systematic component  observed across subjects.},
